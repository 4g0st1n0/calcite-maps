This is probably the easiest way, but you won't get any of the helpful Sass mixins and you will have to manually keep your project in sync with Calcite-Bootstrap. However, if you're looking to get up and running quickly, just [download the latest release](https://github.com/ArcGIS/calcite-bootstrap/releases) and move the zipped files to wherever you keep your assets (CSS, JavaScript, images). Be sure to use [the documentation site](http://esri.github.io/calcite-bootstrap/) and the [main Bootstrap site](http://getbootstrap.com) to copy and paste patterns, components, and even a sample html boilerplate.

*A CDN is being planned for future releases, allowing you to reference Calcite Bootstrap static assets on a server.*
