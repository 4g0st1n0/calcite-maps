Calcite Bootstrap is a UI Kit built on the popular [Bootstrap css framework](http://getbootstrap.com).

Calcite Bootstrap is an adaptation of Calcite, the desktop framework developed for ArcGIS Pro. The idea is to have designs be consistent, but also embrace the characteristics that make each medium unique.

Calcite Bootstrap was built *for* developers who have experience working with Bootstrap markup and classes. 

## Using Calcite Bootstrap

Since Calcite-Bootstrap is built on top of Bootstrap, the best source for documentation is the [Bootstrap site](http://getbootstrap.com).

There are three ways to use Calcite Bootstrap:

- (a) copying static files into your project
- (b) installing via a package manager
- (c) loading files from the cdn

Using this framework as a Sass library will give you the most power, but whatever your flavor, we have you covered.
